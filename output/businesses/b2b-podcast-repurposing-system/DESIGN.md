## Overview

B2B Podcast Repurposing System should feel like a credible, revenue-oriented B2B SaaS validation product. Direction: creator-operator B2B media engine: intelligent repurposing, premium content workflow.

## Colors

- **Primary (#7C3AED):** main CTA and active states.
- **Secondary (#18181B):** navigation, headings, strong structure.
- **Accent (#4f46e5):** conversion highlights, urgency, badges, metrics.
- **Background (#F8FAFC):** clean SaaS page background.
- **Surface (#FFFFFF):** cards, dashboards, forms, admin panels.

## Typography

Use Inter or a close system sans. Headlines should be commercial and compact; body copy should be clear, practical, and buyer-focused.

## Layout

Frontend: header, admin-editable hero carousel, proof/features, CTA/contact/payment path, footer. Admin: sidebar/topbar, carousel editor, lead/content controls, status metrics.

## Components

Use the same tokens across frontend, admin, image prompts, and placeholder backgrounds. Do not introduce random palette choices per section.

## Do's and Don'ts

Do keep all UI and images aligned with this file. Do not ship generic placeholder visuals without `IMAGE_REQUIREMENTS.md` and `contextoparalaimagenconcepto.md`.
